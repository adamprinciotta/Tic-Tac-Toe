I have now made a different css file for mobile sizes. You can now use Tab and Enter to scroll through left to right, then top to bottom.
Also once you use enter for one space, you can then use arrow keys to go any direction and use Enter again to fill the highlighted cell.
One thing I could not figure out which could prevent it from being an AAA would be that you can still move around the cells even when the
game is done. And everytime you select one, it sends you back up to the top left. I could not find a good way to stop it with the way
my code works. Also it would have been nice to let them use arrow keys immediately, but I needed some function call before allowing it,
so the next best thing was to let them select the first square using Tab+Enter or left clicking, then using arrow keys from there if they
wish to do so.
